# binarytree Operation
data structures, DUT CS Course Data Structures and Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project implements basic operations on a binary tree using a binary linked list structure. It includes functions to create a binary tree from a preorder traversal sequence, count leaf nodes in a subtree, and display the binary tree in a tree-like format.

### Features
1. **CreateBT**: Create a binary tree from a given preorder traversal sequence where "#" represents a null node.
2. **CountLeaf**: Count the number of leaf nodes in the subtree rooted at a node with a specific value.
3. **DispBiTree**: Display the binary tree in a structured, tree-like format.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
